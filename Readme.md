# Chat App

## Backend Exploration

This project involves exploring various backend technologies to determine the best fit for our needs. We are currently evaluating:

- **Node.js**:

  - **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework (being used for the Chat App).

- **Dart**:
  - **Dart Frog**: A fast, minimalistic backend framework for Dart (being used for the Todo App).
